 So I never really knew you God I really tried to Blindsided addicted Thought we could really do this But really I was foolish Hindsight it's obvious   Talking with my lawyer She said Where’d you find this guy I said Young people fall in love With the wrong people sometimes   Some mistakes get made That's alright that's okay You can think that you’re in love When you're really just in pain Some mistakes get made That's alright that's okay In the end it's better for me That's the moral of the story babe      It's funny how a memory Turns into a bad dream When running wild turns volatile Remember how we painted our house Just like my grandparents did So romantic but we fought the whole time Should've seen the signs yeah   Talking with my mother She said Where’d you find this guy Said Some people fall in love With the wrong people sometimes   Some mistakes get made That’s alright that's okay You can think that you’re in love When you're really just in pain Some mistakes get made That's alright that's okay In the end it’s better for me That's the moral of the story babe        They say it's better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all That could be a load of shit But I just need to tell you all   Some mistakes get made That's alright that's okay You can think that you're in love When you're really just engaged Some mistakes get made That's alright that's okay In the end it's better for me That's the moral of the story Some mistakes get made That's alright that's okay You can think that you're in love When you're really just in pain Some mistakes get made That's alright that's okay In the end it's better for me That's the moral of the story babe        
 Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me But bear this in mind it was meant to be And I'm joinin' up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks And it all makes sense to me I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile You've never loved your stomach or your thighs The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine But I'll love them endlessly   I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth But if I do it's you oh it's you they add up to I'm in love with you and all these little things   You can't go to bed without a cup of tea And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep Though it makes no sense to me I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape You never want to know how much you weigh You still have to squeeze into your jeans But you're perfect to me   I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth But if it's true it's you it's you they add up to I'm in love with you and all these little things  You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you And you'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to If I let you know I'm here for you Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you oh   And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth 'Cause it's you oh it's you it's you they add up to And I'm in love with you and all these little things   I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth But if it's true it's you it's you they add up to I'm in love with you and all your little things
