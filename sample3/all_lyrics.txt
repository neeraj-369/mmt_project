 Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me But bear this in mind it was meant to be And I'm joinin' up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks And it all makes sense to me I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile You've never loved your stomach or your thighs The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine But I'll love them endlessly   I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth But if I do it's you oh it's you they add up to I'm in love with you and all these little things   You can't go to bed without a cup of tea And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep Though it makes no sense to me I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape You never want to know how much you weigh You still have to squeeze into your jeans But you're perfect to me   I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth But if it's true it's you it's you they add up to I'm in love with you and all these little things  You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you And you'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to If I let you know I'm here for you Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you oh   And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth 'Cause it's you oh it's you it's you they add up to And I'm in love with you and all these little things   I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth But if it's true it's you it's you they add up to I'm in love with you and all your little things
 Years ago when I was younger I kinda liked a girl I knew She was mine and we were sweethearts That was then but then it's true   I'm in love with a fairytale Even though it hurts 'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind I'm already cursed     Every day we started fighting Every night we fell in love No one else could make me sadder But no one else could lift me high above  I don't know what I was doing When suddenly we fell apart Nowadays I cannot find her But when I do we'll get a brand new start   I'm in love with a fairytale Even though it hurts 'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind I'm already cursed    She's a fairytale yeah Even though it hurts 'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind I'm already cursed  
 Can you remember remember my name As I flow through your life A thousand oceans I have flown Oh oh oh And cold cold spirits of ice ah ah All my life I am the echo of your past   I am returning the echo of a point in time And distant faces shine A thousand warriors I have known Oh oh oh oh And laughing as the spirits appear All your life Shadows of another day   And if you hear me talking on the wind You've got to understand We must remain perfect strangers   Ah ah ah no I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow   A strand of silver hanging through the sky Touching more than you see The voice of ages in your mind oh oh oh Is aching with the dead of the night Oh uh oh precious life Your tears are lost in falling rain   And if you hear me talking on the wind You've got to understand We must remain perfect strangers   Oh oh oh Oh yeah
 Feel something right and feel something good 'Cause if one thing works you might know it's true it's true   'Cause if this is the life this is the life This is the life this is the life This is the life then who'd argue And if this is the life this is the life This is the life this is the life This is the life then who'd argue   One year five days we're starting new Try to make a change it's one more thing to do to do   'Cause if this is the life this is the life This is the life this is the life This is the life then who'd argue 'Cause if this is the life this is the life This is the life this is the life This is the life then who'd argue And if this is the life this is the life This is the life this is the life This is the life then who'd argue Then who'd argue

 I'll sing it one last time for you Then we really have to go You've been the only thing that's right In all I've done   And I can barely look at you But every single time I do I know we'll make it anywhere Away from here   Light up light up As if you have a choice Even if you cannot hear my voice I'll be right beside you dear Louder louder And we'll run for our lives I can hardly speak I understand Why you can't raise your voice to say   To think I might not see those eyes Makes it so hard not to cry And as we say our long goodbye I nearly do  Light up light up As if you have a choice Even if you cannot hear my voice I'll be right beside you dear Louder louder And we'll run for our lives I can hardly speak I understand Why you can't raise your voice to say   Slower slower We don't have time for that All I want's to find an easy way To get out of our little heads Have heart my dear We're bound to be afraid Even if it's just for a few days Making up for all this mess     Light up light up As if you have a choice Even if you cannot hear my voice I'll be right beside you dear
