 Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me But bear this in mind it was meant to be And I'm joinin' up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks And it all makes sense to me I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile You've never loved your stomach or your thighs The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine But I'll love them endlessly   I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth But if I do it's you oh it's you they add up to I'm in love with you and all these little things   You can't go to bed without a cup of tea And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep Though it makes no sense to me I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape You never want to know how much you weigh You still have to squeeze into your jeans But you're perfect to me   I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth But if it's true it's you it's you they add up to I'm in love with you and all these little things  You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you And you'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to If I let you know I'm here for you Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you oh   And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth 'Cause it's you oh it's you it's you they add up to And I'm in love with you and all these little things   I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth But if it's true it's you it's you they add up to I'm in love with you and all your little things

 It was a fun strange summer I rolled on didn't think of you We lost touch with each other Fall came and I had to move   Movin' backwards hurt comes after Healin' doesn't happen in a straight line   If I cry just a little and then laugh in the middle If I hate you and I love you and then I change my mind If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact That you shoulda treated me right Then I'm more than just a little justified Mm mm I'm more than just a little justified   To touch somebody You know I tried to make that you And when you lied said you didn't want me Tell me what was I supposed to do   Movin' onwards feelin' strong but Healin' doesn't happen in a straight line  If I cry just a little and then laugh in the middle If I hate you and I love you and then I change my mind If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact That you shoulda treated me right Then I'm more than just a little justified Mm mm I'm more than just a little justified   If I die just a little inside just a little If I want you and I call you then I change my mind If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact That I shoulda treated you right I'm more than just a little   If I cry just a little and then laugh in the middle And I hate you and I love you and then I change my mind  If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact That you shoulda treated me right Then I'm more than just a little justified Mm mm I'm more than just a little justified
   I'm not in love so don't forget it It's just a silly phase I'm going through And just because I call you up Don't get me wrong don't think you've got it made   I'm not in love no no    I like to see you but then again That doesn't mean you mean that much to me So if I call you don't make a fuss Don't tell your friends about the two of us   I'm not in love no no    Be quiet big boys don't cry Big boys don't cry Big boys don't cry Big boys don't cry Big boys don't cry Big boys don't cry...  I keep your picture upon the wall It hides a nasty stain that's lying there So don't you ask me to give it back I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me   I'm not in love no no    Ooh you'll wait a long time for me Ooh you'll wait a long time Ooh you'll wait a long time for me Ooh you'll wait a long time   I'm not in love so don't forget it It's just a silly phase I'm going through And just because I call you up Don't get me wrong don't think you've got it made ooh   I'm not in love I'm not in love
