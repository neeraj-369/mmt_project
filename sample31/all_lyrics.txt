 Ooh   Balloons are deflated Guess they look lifeless like me We miss you on your side of the bed mmm Still got your things here And they stare at me like souvenirs Don't wanna let you out my head   Just like the day that I met you the day I thought forever Said that you love me but that'll last for never It's cold outside like when you walked out my life Why you walk out my life   I get like this every time On these days that feel like you and me Heartbreak anniversary 'Cause I remember every time On these days that feel like you and me Heartbreak anniversary do you ever think of me  No  No no no  Ooh nah   I'm buildin' my hopes up Like presents unopened 'til this day I still see the messages you read mmm I'm foolishly patient  Can't get past the taste of your lips  Don't wanna let you out my head   Just like the day that I met you the day I thought forever Said that you love me but that'll last for never It's cold outside like when you walked out my life Why you walk out my life    I get like this every time On these days that feel like you and me Heartbreak anniversary 'Cause I remember every time On these days that feel like you and me Heartbreak anniversary do you ever think of me  Of me  'Cause I think of you think of you 
 Thought I found a way Thought I found a way out  But you never go away  So I guess I gotta stay now   Oh I hope some day I'll make it out of here Even if it takes all night or a hundred years Need a place to hide but I can't find one near Wanna feel alive outside I can't fight my fear   Isn't it lovely all alone Heart made of glass my mind of stone Tear me to pieces skin to bone Hello welcome home   Walking out of time Looking for a better place  Something's on my mind Always in my head space   But I know someday I'll make it out of here Even if it takes all night or a hundred years Need a place to hide but I can't find one near Wanna feel alive outside I can't fight my fear  Isn't it lovely all alone Heart made of glass my mind of stone Tear me to pieces skin to bone Hello welcome home   Woah yeah Yeah ah Woah woah Hello welcome home
 Not tryna be indie Not tryna be cool Just tryna be in this Tell me are you too Can you feel where the wind is Can you feel it through All of the windows Inside this room   'Cause I wanna touch you baby And I wanna feel you too I wanna see the sun rise on your sins Just me and you   Light it up on the run Let's make love tonight Make it up fall in love try    But you'll never be alone I'll be with you from dusk till dawn I'll be with you from dusk till dawn Baby I'm right here I'll hold you when things go wrong I'll be with you from dusk till dawn I'll be with you from dusk till dawn Baby I'm right here  I'll be with you from dusk till dawn Baby I'm right here   We were shut like a jacket So do your zip We would roll down the rapids To find a wave that fits Can you feel where the wind is Can you feel it through All of the windows Inside this room   'Cause I wanna touch you baby I wanna feel you too I wanna see the sun rise on your sins Just me and you   Light it up on the run Let's make love tonight Make it up fall in love try   But you'll never be alone I'll be with you from dusk till dawn I'll be with you from dusk till dawn Baby I'm right here I'll hold you when things go wrong I'll be with you from dusk till dawn I'll be with you from dusk till dawn Baby I'm right here   Girl give love to your body It's only you that can stop it Girl give love to your body It's only you that can stop it Girl give love to your body It's only you that can stop it Girl give love to your body Girl give love to your body   But you'll never be alone I'll be with you from dusk till dawn I'll be with you from dusk till dawn Baby I'm right here I'll hold you when things go wrong I'll be with you from dusk till dawn I'll be with you from dusk till dawn Baby I'm right here  I'll be with you from dusk till dawn Baby I'm right here
