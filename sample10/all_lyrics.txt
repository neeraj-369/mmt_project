 Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me But bear this in mind it was meant to be And I'm joinin' up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks And it all makes sense to me I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile You've never loved your stomach or your thighs The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine But I'll love them endlessly   I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth But if I do it's you oh it's you they add up to I'm in love with you and all these little things   You can't go to bed without a cup of tea And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep Though it makes no sense to me I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape You never want to know how much you weigh You still have to squeeze into your jeans But you're perfect to me   I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth But if it's true it's you it's you they add up to I'm in love with you and all these little things  You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you And you'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to If I let you know I'm here for you Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you oh   And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth 'Cause it's you oh it's you it's you they add up to And I'm in love with you and all these little things   I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth But if it's true it's you it's you they add up to I'm in love with you and all your little things
