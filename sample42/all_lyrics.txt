 Hey sorry I missed your call just leave a message after the beep Hey yeah it's me just been thinking about everything tonight And I don't know I just miss you so much Give me a call back if you can   Picture perfect memories Scattered all around the floor Reachin' for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore   And I wonder if I ever cross your mind For me it happens all the time   It's a quarter after one I'm all alone and I need you now Said I wouldn't call but I've lost all control and I need you now And I don't know how I can do without I just need you now   Another shot of whiskey Can't stop lookin' at the door Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before  And I wonder if I ever cross your mind For me it happens all the time   It's a quarter after one I'm a little drunk and I need you now Said I wouldn't call but I've lost all control and I need you now And I don't know how I can do without I just need you now Whoa oh   I guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all   It's a quarter after one I'm all alone and I need you now And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now And I don't know how I can do without I just need you now   I just need you now Oh baby I need you now

 All I need's a little love in my life All I need's a little love in the dark A little but I'm hoping it might kickstart Me and my broken heart I need a little loving tonight Hold me so I'm not falling apart A little but I'm hoping it might kickstart Me and my broken heart  Let's go   Shotgun aimed at my heart you got one Tear me apart and then some How do we call this love Drop  I try to run away but your eyes Tell me to stay oh why Why do we call this love    It seems like we've been losing control baby Somebody tell me I'm not alone When I say  All I need's a little love in my life All I need's a little love in the dark A little but I'm hoping it might kickstart Me and my broken heart I need a little loving tonight Hold me so I'm not falling apart A little but I'm hoping it might kickstart Me and my broken heart Aye   Maybe some part of you just hates me You pick me up and play me How do we call this love  One time tell me you need me tonight To make it easy You lie and say it's all for love    It seems like we've been losing control baby Somebody tell me I'm not alone When I say  All I need's a little love in my life All I need's a little love in the dark A little but I'm hoping it might kickstart Me and my broken heart I need a little loving tonight Hold me so I'm not falling apart A little but I'm hoping it might kickstart Me and my broken heart   Woah woah Me and my broken heart Woah woah Me and my broken Yeah yeah Me and my broken Yeah ooh  Ah ah ah ah   All I need's a little love in my life All I need's a little love in the dark A little but I'm hoping it might kickstart Me and my broken heart I need a little loving tonight Hold me so I'm not falling apart A little but I'm hoping it might kickstart Me and my broken heart Woo
