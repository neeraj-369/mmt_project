 So I never really knew you God I really tried to Blindsided addicted Thought we could really do this But really I was foolish Hindsight it's obvious   Talking with my lawyer She said Where’d you find this guy I said Young people fall in love With the wrong people sometimes   Some mistakes get made That's alright that's okay You can think that you’re in love When you're really just in pain Some mistakes get made That's alright that's okay In the end it's better for me That's the moral of the story babe      It's funny how a memory Turns into a bad dream When running wild turns volatile Remember how we painted our house Just like my grandparents did So romantic but we fought the whole time Should've seen the signs yeah   Talking with my mother She said Where’d you find this guy Said Some people fall in love With the wrong people sometimes   Some mistakes get made That’s alright that's okay You can think that you’re in love When you're really just in pain Some mistakes get made That's alright that's okay In the end it’s better for me That's the moral of the story babe        They say it's better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all That could be a load of shit But I just need to tell you all   Some mistakes get made That's alright that's okay You can think that you're in love When you're really just engaged Some mistakes get made That's alright that's okay In the end it's better for me That's the moral of the story Some mistakes get made That's alright that's okay You can think that you're in love When you're really just in pain Some mistakes get made That's alright that's okay In the end it's better for me That's the moral of the story babe
