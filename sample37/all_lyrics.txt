 Sometimes you get what you've always been wishing for And most times it's not on your deadline but that's alright I was worn out and jaded from trying on people to love But you fit so well   When they ask why I can never explain But a symphony played when you told me your name And I took that as a sign   Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be mine   Mmm mmm   Sometimes it's hard to see what the future holds And most times it feels like a steep climb and that's alright There's magic in details the tender small gestures of love And the way they all add up  When they ask why I can never explain But a symphony played when you told me your name And it sounded like a sign   Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be mine   Five years later and I'm still yours Ten years later and I'm still yours Fifty years later and I'm still your beginning and middle and end Five years later and I'm still yours Ten years later and I'm still yours Fifty years later and I'm still your beginning and middle and end Beginning and middle and end    Will you be my beginning my middle my end  Will you be my beginning my middle my end  Will you be my beginning my middle my end  Will you be mine

 Go for it One two   Baby really hurt me crying in the taxi He don't wanna know me Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm Says it was poison So I guess I'll go home Into the arms of the girl that I love The only love I haven't screwed up She's so hard to please but she's a forest fire I do my best to meet her demands play at romance We slow dance in the living room But all that a stranger would see Is one girl swaying alone stroking a cheek   They say You're a little much for me You're a liability You're a little much for me So they pull back make other plans I understand I'm a liability Get you wild make you leave I'm a little much for e a na na na everyone  The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy Till all of the tricks don't work anymore And then they are bored of me I know that it's exciting running through the night But every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone Better on my own   They say You're a little much for me You're a liability You're a little much for me So they pull back make other plans I understand I'm a liability Get you wild make you leave I'm a little much for e a na na na everyone   They're gonna watch me disappear into the sun You're all gonna watch me disappear into the sun
