 Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain I leave my heart open But it stays right here empty for days She told me in the morning She don't feel the same about us in her bones It seems to me that when I die These words will be written on my stone   And I'll be gone gone tonight  The ground beneath my feet is open wide  The way that I've been holding on too tight  With nothing in between   The story of my life I take her home I drive all night to keep her warm And time is frozen  The story of my life I give her hope I spend her love until she's broke inside The story of my life    Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change Leave my heart open But it stays right here in its cage I know that in the morning I'll see us in the light up on the hill Although I am broken my heart is untamed still  And I'll be gone gone tonight  The fire beneath my feet is burning bright  The way that I've been holding on so tight  With nothing in between   The story of my life I take her home I drive all night to keep her warm And time is frozen  The story of my life I give her hope I spend her love until she's broke inside The story of my life    And I've been waiting for this time to come around But baby running after you Is like chasing the clouds   The story of my life I take her home I drive all night to keep her warm And time is frozen   The story of my life I give her hope  I spend her love until she's broke inside  The story of my life   The story of my life The story of my life  The story of my life

 I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning   I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know   I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you   I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with every day And all the pain I put you through   I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears That's why I need you to hear  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you   And the reason is you And the reason is you And the reason is you   I'm not a perfect person   I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know   I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you
 We were good we were gold Kinda dream that can't be sold We were right 'til we weren't Built a home and watched it burn   Mm I didn't wanna leave you I didn't wanna lie Started to cry but then remembered I   I can buy myself flowers Write my name in the sand Talk to myself for hours Say things you don't understand I can take myself dancing And I can hold my own hand Yeah I can love me better than you can   Can love me better I can love me better baby Can love me better I can love me better baby   Paint my nails cherry red Match the roses that you left No remorse no regret I forgive every word you said  Ooh I didn't wanna leave you baby I didn't wanna fight Started to cry but then remembered I   I can buy myself flowers Write my name in the sand Talk to myself for hours yeah Say things you don't understand I can take myself dancing yeah I can hold my own hand Yeah I can love me better than you can   Can love me better I can love me better baby Can love me better I can love me better baby Can love me better I can love me better baby Can love me better I    I didn't wanna leave you I didn't wanna fight Started to cry but then remembered I   I can buy myself flowers  Write my name in the sand Talk to myself for hours  Say things you don't understand  I can take myself dancing yeah I can hold my own hand Yeah I can love me better than Yeah I can love me better than you can  Can love me better I can love me better baby  Can love me better I can love me better baby  Can love me better I can love me better baby Can love me better I
   For all the times that you rained on my parade And all the clubs you get in using my name You think you broke my heart oh girl for goodness' sake You think I'm cryin' on my own well I ain't   And I didn't wanna write a song 'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care I don't but you still hit my phone up And baby I'll be movin' on And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back Maybe you should know that   My mama don't like you and she likes everyone And I never like to admit that I was wrong And I've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going on But now I know I'm better sleeping on my own   'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself  But when you told me that you hated my friends The only problem was with you and not them And every time you told me my opinion was wrong And tried to make me forget where I came from   And I didn't wanna write a song 'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care I don't but you still hit my phone up And baby I'll be movin' on And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back Maybe you should know that   My mama don't like you and she likes everyone And I never like to admit that I was wrong And I've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going on But now I know I'm better sleeping on my own   'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself  For all the times that you made me feel small I fell in love now I feel nothin' at all I never felt so low and I was vulnerable Was I a fool to let you break down my walls   'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself 'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself
