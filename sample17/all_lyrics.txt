 Ah ah Ah ah   You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you Be like Heaven to touch I wanna hold you so much Long last love has arrived I thank God that I'm alive You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you    Pardon the way that I stare There's nothing else to compare The thought of you leaves me weak There are no words left to speak But if you feel how I feel Please let me know that it's real You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you   I love you baby and if it's quite alright I need you baby to warm these lonely nights I love you baby trust in me when I say Oh pretty baby don't let me down I pray Oh pretty baby now that I have you stay And let me love you baby let me love you  You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you You'd be like Heaven to touch I wanna hold you so much Long last love has arrived I thank God that I'm alive You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you    Pardon the way that I stare There's nothing else to compare The thought of you leaves me weak There are no words left to speak But if you feel how I feel Please let me know that it's real You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you   I love you baby and if it's quite alright I need you baby to warm these lonely nights I love you baby trust in me when I say Oh pretty baby don't let me down I pray Oh pretty baby now that I have you stay And let me love you baby let me love you
 Yelling at the sky Screaming at the world Baby why'd you go away I’m still your girl Holding on too tight Head up in the clouds Heaven only knows where you are now   How do I love how do I love again How do I trust how do I trust again   I stay up all night tell myself I'm alright Baby you're just harder to see than most I put the record on wait ’til I hear our song Every night I'm dancing with your ghost Every night I'm dancing with your ghost   Never got the chance To say your last goodbye I gotta move on But it hurts to try  How do I love how do I love again How do I trust how do I trust again   I stay up all night tell myself I'm alright Baby you're just harder to see than most I put the record on wait 'til I hear our song Every night I'm dancing with your ghost Every night I'm dancing with your ghost   How do I love how do I love again How do I trust how do I trust again   I stay up all night tell myself I’m alright Baby you’re just harder to see than most I put the record on wait 'til I hear our song Every night I’m dancing with your ghost Every night I'm dancing with your ghost Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
 We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January And this is our place we make the rules And there's a dazzling haze a mysterious way about you dear Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years   Can I go where you go Can we always be this close Forever and ever ah Take me out and take me home You're my my my my lover   We could let our friends crash in the living room This is our place we make the call And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you I've loved you three summers now honey but I want 'em all   Can I go where you go Can we always be this close Forever and ever ah Take me out and take me home  You're my my my my lover  Ladies and gentlemen will you please stand With every guitar string scar on my hand I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue All's well that ends well to end up with you Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me And at every table I'll save you a seat lover   Can I go where you go Can we always be this close Forever and ever ah Take me out and take me home  You're my my my my Oh you're my my my my Darling you're my my my my lover
   For all the times that you rained on my parade And all the clubs you get in using my name You think you broke my heart oh girl for goodness' sake You think I'm cryin' on my own well I ain't   And I didn't wanna write a song 'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care I don't but you still hit my phone up And baby I'll be movin' on And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back Maybe you should know that   My mama don't like you and she likes everyone And I never like to admit that I was wrong And I've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going on But now I know I'm better sleeping on my own   'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself  But when you told me that you hated my friends The only problem was with you and not them And every time you told me my opinion was wrong And tried to make me forget where I came from   And I didn't wanna write a song 'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care I don't but you still hit my phone up And baby I'll be movin' on And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back Maybe you should know that   My mama don't like you and she likes everyone And I never like to admit that I was wrong And I've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going on But now I know I'm better sleeping on my own   'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself  For all the times that you made me feel small I fell in love now I feel nothin' at all I never felt so low and I was vulnerable Was I a fool to let you break down my walls   'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself 'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself
