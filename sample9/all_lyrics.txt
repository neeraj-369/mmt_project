 Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down 'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name   It all just sounds like  Mm too young too dumb to realize   That I should've bought you flowers And held your hand Shoulda gave you all my hours When I had the chance Take you to every party 'Cause all you wanted to do was dance Now my baby's dancin' But she's dancin' with another man   Uh my pride my ego my needs and my selfish ways Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life Now I'll never never get to clean up the mess I made oh And that haunts me every time I close my eyes  It all just sounds like  Mm too young too dumb to realize   That I should've bought you flowers And held your hand Shoulda gave you all my hours When I had the chance Take you to every party 'Cause all you wanted to do was dance Now my baby's dancin' But she's dancin' with another man   Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong Oh I know I'm probably much too late To try and apologize for my mistakes But I just want you to know   I hope he buys you flowers I hope he holds your hand Give you all his hours When he has the chance Take you to every party 'Cause I remember how much you love to dance Do all the things I should've done When I was your man Do all the things I should've done When I was your man

 There is a swelling storm And I'm caught up in the middle of it all And it takes control of the person that I thought I was The boy I used to know But there is a light in the dark And I feel its warmth In my hands in my heart But why can't I hold on   It comes and goes in waves It always does always does We watch as our young hearts fade Into the flood into the flood   And the freedom of falling The feeling I thought was set in stone It slips through my fingers I'm trying hard to let go It comes and goes in waves It comes and goes in waves And carries us away   Through the wind Down to the place we used to lay when we were kids Memories of a stolen place Caught in the silence an echo lost in space  It comes and goes in waves It always does it always does We watch as our young hearts fade Into the flood into the flood   And the freedom of falling The feeling I thought was set in stone It slips through my fingers I'm trying hard to let go It comes and goes in waves It comes and goes in waves And carries us away   I've watched my wild youth Disappear in front of my eyes Moments of magic and wonder It seems so hard to find Is it ever coming back again Is it ever coming back again Take me back to the feeling when Everything was left to find   It comes and goes in waves It always does it always does  And the freedom of falling The feeling I thought was set in stone It slips through my fingers I'm trying hard to let go It comes and goes in waves It comes and goes in waves And carries us away

 Show me the meaning of being lonely   So many words for the broken heart It is hard to see in a crimson love So hard to breathe Walk with me and maybe Nights of light so soon become Wild and free I could feel the sun Your every wish will be done They tell me   Show me the meaning of being lonely Is this the feeling I need to walk with Tell me why I can't be there where you are There's somethin' missin' in my heart   Life goes on as it never ends Eyes of stone observe the trends They never say forever gaze if only Guilty roads to an endless love  There's no control are you with me now Your every wish will be done They tell me  Show me the meaning of being lonely Is this the feeling I need to walk with  Tell me why I can't be there where you are There's somethin' missin' in my heart    There's nowhere to run I have no place to go Surrender my heart body and soul How can it be you're askin' me To feel the things you never show    You are missin' in my heart Tell me why can't I be there where you are   Show me the meaning of being lonely  Is this the feeling I need to walk with  Tell me why I can't be there where you are  There's somethin' missin' in my heart  Show me the meaning of being lonely  Is this the feeling I need to walk with Tell me why I can't be there where you are  There's somethin' missin' in my heart
