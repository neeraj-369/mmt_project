 Can you remember remember my name As I flow through your life A thousand oceans I have flown Oh oh oh And cold cold spirits of ice ah ah All my life I am the echo of your past   I am returning the echo of a point in time And distant faces shine A thousand warriors I have known Oh oh oh oh And laughing as the spirits appear All your life Shadows of another day   And if you hear me talking on the wind You've got to understand We must remain perfect strangers   Ah ah ah no I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow   A strand of silver hanging through the sky Touching more than you see The voice of ages in your mind oh oh oh Is aching with the dead of the night Oh uh oh precious life Your tears are lost in falling rain   And if you hear me talking on the wind You've got to understand We must remain perfect strangers   Oh oh oh Oh yeah
