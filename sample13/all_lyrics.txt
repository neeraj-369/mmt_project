 Years ago when I was younger I kinda liked a girl I knew She was mine and we were sweethearts That was then but then it's true   I'm in love with a fairytale Even though it hurts 'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind I'm already cursed     Every day we started fighting Every night we fell in love No one else could make me sadder But no one else could lift me high above  I don't know what I was doing When suddenly we fell apart Nowadays I cannot find her But when I do we'll get a brand new start   I'm in love with a fairytale Even though it hurts 'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind I'm already cursed    She's a fairytale yeah Even though it hurts 'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind I'm already cursed  
 Do you ever feel like a plastic bag Drifting through the wind wanting to start again Do you ever feel feel so paper thin Like a house of cards one blow from cavin' in Do you ever feel already buried deep Six feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing Do you know that there's still a chance for you 'Cause there's a spark in you   You just gotta ignite the light And let it shine Just own the night Like the Fourth of July   'Cause baby you're a firework Come on show 'em what you're worth Make 'em go Awe awe awe As you shoot across the sky y y Baby you're a firework Come on let your colors burst Make 'em go Awe awe awe You're gonna leave 'em all in awe awe awe  You don't have to feel like a waste of space You're original cannot be replaced If you only knew what the future holds After a hurricane comes a rainbow Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road Like a lightning bolt your heart will glow And when it's time you'll know   You just gotta ignite the light And let it shine Just own the night Like the Fourth of July   'Cause baby you're a firework Come on show 'em what you're worth Make 'em go Awe awe awe As you shoot across the sky y y Baby you're a firework Come on let your colors burst Make 'em go Awe awe awe You're gonna leave 'em all in awe awe awe  Boom boom boom Even brighter than the moon moon moon It's always been inside of you you you And now it's time to let it throu ou ough   'Cause baby you're a firework Come on show 'em what you're worth Make 'em go Awe awe awe As you shoot across the sky y y Baby you're a firework Come on let your colors burst Make 'em go Awe awe awe You're gonna leave 'em all in awe awe awe   Boom boom boom Even brighter than the moon moon moon Boom boom boom Even brighter than the moon moon moon
