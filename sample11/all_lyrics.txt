 Years ago when I was younger I kinda liked a girl I knew She was mine and we were sweethearts That was then but then it's true   I'm in love with a fairytale Even though it hurts 'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind I'm already cursed     Every day we started fighting Every night we fell in love No one else could make me sadder But no one else could lift me high above  I don't know what I was doing When suddenly we fell apart Nowadays I cannot find her But when I do we'll get a brand new start   I'm in love with a fairytale Even though it hurts 'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind I'm already cursed    She's a fairytale yeah Even though it hurts 'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind I'm already cursed  
 Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain I leave my heart open But it stays right here empty for days She told me in the morning She don't feel the same about us in her bones It seems to me that when I die These words will be written on my stone   And I'll be gone gone tonight  The ground beneath my feet is open wide  The way that I've been holding on too tight  With nothing in between   The story of my life I take her home I drive all night to keep her warm And time is frozen  The story of my life I give her hope I spend her love until she's broke inside The story of my life    Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change Leave my heart open But it stays right here in its cage I know that in the morning I'll see us in the light up on the hill Although I am broken my heart is untamed still  And I'll be gone gone tonight  The fire beneath my feet is burning bright  The way that I've been holding on so tight  With nothing in between   The story of my life I take her home I drive all night to keep her warm And time is frozen  The story of my life I give her hope I spend her love until she's broke inside The story of my life    And I've been waiting for this time to come around But baby running after you Is like chasing the clouds   The story of my life I take her home I drive all night to keep her warm And time is frozen   The story of my life I give her hope  I spend her love until she's broke inside  The story of my life   The story of my life The story of my life  The story of my life
