 There's no reason there's no rhyme I found myself blindsided by A feeling that I've never known I'm dealing with it on my own Phone is quiet walls are bare I drink myself to sleep who cares No one even has to know I'm dealing with it on my own   I've got way too much time to be this hurt Somebody help it's getting worse What do you do with a broken heart Once the light fades everything is dark Way too much whiskey in my blood I feel my body giving up Can I hold on for another night What do I do with all this time   Heavy thoughts when it gets late Put me in a fragile state I wish I wasn't going home Dealing with it on my own I'm praying but it's not enough I'm done I don't believe in love Learning how to let it go Dealing with it on my own  I've got way too much time to be this hurt Somebody help it's getting worse What do you do with a broken heart Once the light fades everything is dark Way too much whiskey in my blood I feel my body giving up Can I hold on for another night What do I do with all this time Yeah   I drive circles under street lights Nothing seems to clear my mind I can't forget Get this out my head so I drive chasing Malibu nights Nothing seems to heal my mind I can't forget   I've got way too much time to be this hurt Somebody help it's getting worse What do you do with a broken heart Once the light fades everything is dark Way too much whiskey in my blood I feel my body giving up Can I hold on for another night What do I do with all this time Yeah  I drive circles under street lights Nothing seems to clear my mind I can't forget Get this out my head so I drive chasing Malibu nights Nothing seems to heal my mind I can't forget  I drive chasing Malibu nights Hey yeah na na ah yeah
 There is a swelling storm And I'm caught up in the middle of it all And it takes control of the person that I thought I was The boy I used to know But there is a light in the dark And I feel its warmth In my hands in my heart But why can't I hold on   It comes and goes in waves It always does always does We watch as our young hearts fade Into the flood into the flood   And the freedom of falling The feeling I thought was set in stone It slips through my fingers I'm trying hard to let go It comes and goes in waves It comes and goes in waves And carries us away   Through the wind Down to the place we used to lay when we were kids Memories of a stolen place Caught in the silence an echo lost in space  It comes and goes in waves It always does it always does We watch as our young hearts fade Into the flood into the flood   And the freedom of falling The feeling I thought was set in stone It slips through my fingers I'm trying hard to let go It comes and goes in waves It comes and goes in waves And carries us away   I've watched my wild youth Disappear in front of my eyes Moments of magic and wonder It seems so hard to find Is it ever coming back again Is it ever coming back again Take me back to the feeling when Everything was left to find   It comes and goes in waves It always does it always does  And the freedom of falling The feeling I thought was set in stone It slips through my fingers I'm trying hard to let go It comes and goes in waves It comes and goes in waves And carries us away

 I had a dream I got everything I wanted Not what you'd think And if I'm bein' honest It might've been a nightmare To anyone who might care Thought I could fly  So I stepped off the Golden mm Nobody cried  Nobody even noticed I saw them standing right there Kinda thought they might care    I had a dream I got everything I wanted But when I wake up I see You with me   And you say As long as I'm here no one can hurt you Don't wanna lie here but you can learn to If I could change the way that you see yourself You wouldn't wonder why you hear 'They don't deserve you'  I tried to scream But my head was underwater They called me weak Like I'm not just somebody's daughter Coulda been a nightmare But it felt like they were right there And it feels like yesterday was a year ago But I don't wanna let anybody know 'Cause everybody wants something from me now And I don't wanna let 'em down   I had a dream I got everything I wanted But when I wake up I see You with me   And you say As long as I'm here no one can hurt you Don't wanna lie here but you can learn to If I could change the way that you see yourself You wouldn't wonder why you hear 'They don't deserve you'   If I knew it all then would I do it again Would I do it again If they knew what they said would go straight to my head What would they say instead If I knew it all then would I do it again Would I do it again If they knew what they said would go straight to my head What would they say instead
 Give me a second I I need to get my story straight My friends are in the bathroom getting Higher than the Empire State My lover she is waiting for me just across the bar My seat's been taken by some sunglasses askin' 'bout a scar and I know I gave it to you months ago I know you're tryin' to forget But between the drinks and subtle things The holes in my apologies You know I'm tryin' hard to take it back   So if by the time the bar closes And you feel like fallin' down I'll carry you home   Tonight We are young So let's set the world on fire We can burn brighter than the sun Tonight We are young So let's set the world on fire We can burn brighter than the sun  Now I know that I'm not all that you got I guess that I I just thought Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart But our friends are back so let's raise a toast 'Cause I found someone to carry me home   Tonight We are young So let's set the world on fire We can burn brighter than the sun Tonight We are young So let's set the world on fire We can burn brighter than the sun   Carry me home tonight  Just carry me home tonight  Carry me home tonight  Just carry me home tonight   The moon is on my side I have no reason to run  So will someone come and carry me home tonight  The angels never arrived but I can hear the choir  So will someone come and carry me home  Tonight We are young So let's set the world on fire We can burn brighter than the sun Tonight We are young So let's set the world on fire We can burn brighter than the sun   So if by the time the bar closes And you feel like fallin' down I'll carry you home tonight
 I took a pill in Ibiza to show Avicii I was cool And when I finally got sober felt 10 years older But fuck it it was something to do I'm living out in LA I drive a sports car just to prove I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars And I spend it on girls and shoes   But you don't wanna be high like me Never really knowing why like me You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone You don't wanna ride the bus like this Never knowing who to trust like this You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing Stuck up on that stage singing All I know are sad songs sad songs Darling all I know are sad songs sad songs   I I know are sad songs I I know are sad songs I I know are sad songs I I know are sad songs   I'm just a singer who already blew his shot I get along with old timers 'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot And I can't keep a girl no 'Cause as soon as the sun comes up I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse But the truth is I can't open up  But you don't wanna be high like me Never really knowing why like me You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone You don't wanna ride the bus like this Never knowing who to trust like this You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing Stuck up on that stage singing All I know are sad songs sad songs Darling all I know are sad songs sad songs   I I know are sad songs I I know are sad songs Sad songs I I know are sad songs Sad songs I I know are sad songs
