 I still remember third of December Me in your sweater you said it looked better On me than it did you only if you knew How much I liked you but I watch your eyes as she   Walks by What a sight for sore eyes Brighter than a blue sky She's got you mesmerized while I die   Why would you ever kiss me I'm not even half as pretty You gave her your sweater it's just polyester But you like her better wish I were Heather   Watch as she stands with her holding your hand Put your arm 'round her shoulder now I'm getting colder But how could I hate her She's such an angel But then again kinda wish she were dead as she   Walks by What a sight for sore eyes Brighter than a blue sky She's got you mesmerized while I die  Why would you ever kiss me I'm not even half as pretty You gave her your sweater it's just polyester But you like her better I wish I were Heather    Wish I were Heather  Wish I were Heather   Why would you ever kiss me I'm not even half as pretty You gave her your sweater it's just polyester But you like her better wish I were

   For all the times that you rained on my parade And all the clubs you get in using my name You think you broke my heart oh girl for goodness' sake You think I'm cryin' on my own well I ain't   And I didn't wanna write a song 'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care I don't but you still hit my phone up And baby I'll be movin' on And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back Maybe you should know that   My mama don't like you and she likes everyone And I never like to admit that I was wrong And I've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going on But now I know I'm better sleeping on my own   'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself  But when you told me that you hated my friends The only problem was with you and not them And every time you told me my opinion was wrong And tried to make me forget where I came from   And I didn't wanna write a song 'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care I don't but you still hit my phone up And baby I'll be movin' on And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back Maybe you should know that   My mama don't like you and she likes everyone And I never like to admit that I was wrong And I've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going on But now I know I'm better sleeping on my own   'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself  For all the times that you made me feel small I fell in love now I feel nothin' at all I never felt so low and I was vulnerable Was I a fool to let you break down my walls   'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself 'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself
