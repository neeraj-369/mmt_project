 I love you still And you know I always will Till the end of time I won't change my mind   I swear I'll always give my best no pretending Give you breakfast in bed every morning There ain't no answer to this complex question I just keep falling for you every day Won't ever take up too much time or attention Take a second just to make our connection I would do anything for your affection Kinda fun tryna go about it all the wrong ways   I'm just so into you I wanna let it all out You're so perfectly fine I could talk all day but let me spell it out A B C D E F G H   I love you still And you know I always will Till the end of time I won't change my mind Love you I'll be here I will never disappear Said forever I swear So I will be there  You said you didn't wanna be like everybody else Wanted something only you and I can have ourselves Picture perfect isn't something that I've ever felt Love when you smile right in front of me   I'm just so into you I wanna let it all out You're so perfectly fine I could talk all day but let me spell it out A B C D E F G H   I love you still And you know I always will Till the end of time I won't change my mind Love you I'll be here I will never disappear Said forever I swear So I will be there I love you still And you know I always will Till the end of time I won't change my mind Love you I'll be here I will never disappear Said forever I swear So I will be there
 I wanna hold the hand inside you I wanna take the breath that's true I look to you and I see nothing I look to you to see the truth You live your life you go in shadows You'll come apart and you'll go blind Some kind of night into your darkness Colored your eyes with what's not there   Fade into you Strange you never knew Fade into you I think it's strange you never knew     A stranger's light comes on slowly A stranger's heart without a home You put your hands into your head And then its smiles cover your heart   Fade into you Strange you never knew Fade into you I think it's strange you never knew Fade into you Strange you never knew Fade into you I think it's strange you never knew  I think it's strange you never knew
 I found a guy told me I was a star He held the door held my hand in the dark And he's perfect on paper but he's lying to my face Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved   And there's one more boy he's from my past We fell in love but it didn't last 'Cause the second I figure it out he pushes me away And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway And I say that I'm through but this song's still for you   All I want is love that lasts Is all I want too much to ask Is it something wrong with me All I want is a good guy Are my expectations far too high Try my best but what can I say All I have is myself at the end of the day But shouldn't that be enough for me   Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh And I miss the days when I was young and naive I thought the perfect guy would come and find me Now happy ever after it don't come so easily  All I want is love that lasts Is all I want too much to ask Is it something wrong with me Oh ooh All I want is a good guy Are my expectations far too high Try my best but what can I say All I have is myself at the end of the day And all I want is for that to be okay
