 Sometimes you get what you've always been wishing for And most times it's not on your deadline but that's alright I was worn out and jaded from trying on people to love But you fit so well   When they ask why I can never explain But a symphony played when you told me your name And I took that as a sign   Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be mine   Mmm mmm   Sometimes it's hard to see what the future holds And most times it feels like a steep climb and that's alright There's magic in details the tender small gestures of love And the way they all add up  When they ask why I can never explain But a symphony played when you told me your name And it sounded like a sign   Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be mine   Five years later and I'm still yours Ten years later and I'm still yours Fifty years later and I'm still your beginning and middle and end Five years later and I'm still yours Ten years later and I'm still yours Fifty years later and I'm still your beginning and middle and end Beginning and middle and end    Will you be my beginning my middle my end  Will you be my beginning my middle my end  Will you be my beginning my middle my end  Will you be mine
 Two packs of cigarettes a day The strongest whiskey Kentucky can make That's a recipe To put a vagabond on his hands and knees I watched it all up close I knew him more than most I saw a side of him he never showed Full of sympathy For a world that wouldn't let him be   That's the man he was Have you heard enough   What a shame what a shame To judge a life that you can't change The choir sings the church bells ring So won't you give this man his wings What a shame To have to beg you to see We're not all the same What a shame   There's a hard life for every silver spoon There's a touch of grey for every shade of blue That's the way that I see life If there was nothin' wrong then there'd be nothin' right And for this workin' man they say could barely stand There's gotta be a better place to land Some kind of remedy For a world that wouldn't let him be  That's the man he was Have you heard enough   What a shame what a shame To judge a life that you can't change The choir sings the church bells ring So won't you give this man his wings What a shame To have to beg you to see We're not all the same What a shame   God forgive the hands that laid you down They never knew how Much a broken heart can break the sound And change the seasons Now the leaves are fallin' faster Happily ever after You gave me hope through your endeavors And now you will live forever   What a shame what a shame To judge a life that you can't change The choir sings the church bells ring So won't you give this man his wings What a shame To have to beg you to see We're not all the same What a shame what a shame 'Cause we're not all the same What a shame what a shame 'Cause we're not all the same

 We were both young when I first saw you I close my eyes and the flashback starts I'm standing there On a balcony in summer air See the lights see the party the ball gowns See you make your way through the crowd And say Hello Little did I know   That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet And I was crying on the staircase Begging you Please don't go and I said   Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess It's a love story baby just say Yes   So I sneak out to the garden to see you We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew So close your eyes Escape this town for a little while oh oh  'Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet But you were everything to me I was begging you Please don't go and I said   Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess It's a love story baby just say Yes Romeo save me they're trying to tell me how to feel This love is difficult but it's real Don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess It's a love story baby just say Yes   Oh oh   But I got tired of waiting Wondering if you were ever coming around My faith in you was fading When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said   Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone I keep waiting for you but you never come Is this in my head I don't know what to think He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said Marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone I love you and that's all I really know I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress It's a love story baby just say 'Yes'  Oh oh oh Oh oh oh 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

 Time can never mend The careless whispers Of a good friend To the heart and mind Ignorance is kind There's no comfort in the truth Pain is all you'll find Should've known better yeah     I feel so unsure As I take your hand And lead you to the dance floor As the music dies Something in your eyes Calls to mind a silver screen And all its sad goodbyes   I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet have got no rhythm Though it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool Should've known better than to cheat a friend And waste a chance that I've been given So I'm never gonna dance again The way I danced with you oh  Time can never mend The careless whispers Of a good friend To the heart and mind Ignorance is kind There's no comfort in the truth Pain is all you'll find   I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet have got no rhythm Though it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool Should've known better than to cheat a friend  And waste a chance that I've been given So I'm never gonna dance again The way I danced with you oh   Never without your love   Tonight the music seems so loud I wish that we could lose this crowd Maybe it's better this way We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say We could have been so good together We could have lived this dance forever But now who's gonna dance with me Please stay  And I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet have got no rhythm Though it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool Should've known better than to cheat a friend And waste a chance that I've been given So I'm never gonna dance again The way I danced with you oh    Now that you're gone  Was what I did so wrong so wrong That you had to leave me alone
