 I got my driver's license last week Just like we always talked about 'Cause you were so excited for me To finally drive up to your house But today I drove through the suburbs Crying 'cause you weren't around   And you're probably with that blonde girl Who always made me doubt She's so much older than me She's everything I'm insecure about Yeah today I drove through the suburbs 'Cause how could I ever love someone else   And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me 'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street   And all my friends are tired Of hearing how much I miss you but I kinda feel sorry for them 'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do Yeah today I drove through the suburbs And pictured I was driving home to you  And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one oh And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me 'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street   Red lights stop signs I still see your face in the white cars front yards Can't drive past the places we used to go to 'Cause I still fuckin' love you babe  Sidewalks we crossed I still hear your voice in the traffic we're laughing Over all the noise God I'm so blue know we're through But I still fuckin' love you babe    I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me 'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street   Yeah you said forever now I drive alone past your street
 A broken heart is all that's left I'm still fixing all the cracks Lost a couple of pieces when I carried it carried it carried it home I'm afraid of all I am My mind feels like a foreign land Silence ringing inside my head Please carry me carry me carry me home   I've spent all of the love I saved We were always a losing game Small town boy in a big arcade I got addicted to a losing game   Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh All I know all I know Loving you is a losing game   How many pennies in the slot Giving us up didn't take a lot I saw the end 'fore it begun Still I carried I carried I carry on  Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh All I know all I know Loving you is a losing game Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh All I know all I know Loving you is a losing game   I don't need your games game over Get me off this rollercoaster   Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh All I know all I know Loving you is a losing game Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh All I know all I know Loving you is a losing game
 Laying in the silence Waiting for the sirens Signs any signs I'm alive still I don't wanna lose it But I'm not getting through this Hey should I pray Should I pray yeah to myself To a God To a saviour who can   Unbreak the broken Unsay these spoken words Find hope in the hopeless Pull me out the train wreck Unburn the ashes Unchain the reactions now I'm not ready to die not yet Pull me out the train wreck Pull me out pull me out Pull me out pull me out Pull me out   Underneath our bad blood We've still got a sad song Home still a home still a home here It's not too late to build it back 'Cause a one in a million chance Is still a chance still a chance And I would take those odds  Unbreak the broken Unsay these spoken words Find hope in the hopeless Pull me out the train wreck Unburn the ashes Unchain the reactions now I'm not ready to die not yet Pull me out the train wreck Pull me out pull me out Pull me out pull me out Pull me out pull me out   You can say what you like Don't say I wouldn't die for it  I'm down on my knees And I need you to be my guard Be my help be a saviour Who can   Unbreak the broken Unsay these reckless words  Pull me out the train wreck Unburn the ashes Unchain the reactions now I'm not ready to die not yet Pull me out the train wreck Pull me out pull me out Pull me out pull me out Pull me out pull me out
