 Days pass by and my eyes they dry and I think that I'm okay 'Til I find myself in conversation fading away The way you smile the way you walk The time you took to teach me all that you had taught Tell me how am I supposed to move on   These days I'm becoming everything that I hate Wishing you were around but now it's too late My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost   Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away One more rainy day without you Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day One more rainy day   Oh I'm a wreck without you here Yeah I'm a wreck since you've been gone I've tried to put this all behind me I think I was wrecked all along Yeah I'm a wreck   They say that the time will heal it the pain will go away But everything it reminds me of you and it comes in waves The way you laugh when your shoulders shook The time you took to teach me all that you had taught Tell me how am I supposed to move on  These days I'm becoming everything that I hate Wishing you were around but now it's too late My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost   Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away One more rainy day without you Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day One more rainy day   Oh I'm a wreck without you here Yeah I'm a wreck since you've been gone I've tried to put this all behind me I think I was wrecked all along   These days when I'm on the brink of the edge I remember the words that you said Remember the life you led You'd say Oh suck it all up don't get stuck in the mud Thinking of things that you should have done I'll see you again my loved one I'll see you again my loved one Yeah I'm a wreck I'll see you again my loved one  Yeah I'm a wreck without you here  Yeah I'm a wreck since you've been gone  I've tried to put this all behind me I think I was wrecked all along  Yeah I'm a wreck   Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away  One more rainy day without you  Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day  One more rainy day
