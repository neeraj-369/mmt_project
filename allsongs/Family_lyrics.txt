 Arms like the branches of a poplar tree Eyes like the ocean like the great big blue sea Love just like my mother's a price it's not free Hoo ooh mm   Voice like my father's when he screams the house shakes Dreams like my brother's oh we pray for his sake Hopes just like my mother's oh they last 'til her wake Ooh ah ooh   That's my family Oh we don't like each other very much Oh I'm okay with that But it breaks my mother's heart Ah ooh Ah ooh That's my family   When I'm alone that's when I feel the safest Don't like being touched Please don't give me a hug  That's my family  You're my family  I found my family  This is my family   That's my family Woah woah woah  Woah woah Woah woah Woah woah woah Woah woah woah Woah woah Woah woah woah
