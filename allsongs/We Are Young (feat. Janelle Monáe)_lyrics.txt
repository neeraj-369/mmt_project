 Give me a second I I need to get my story straight My friends are in the bathroom getting Higher than the Empire State My lover she is waiting for me just across the bar My seat's been taken by some sunglasses askin' 'bout a scar and I know I gave it to you months ago I know you're tryin' to forget But between the drinks and subtle things The holes in my apologies You know I'm tryin' hard to take it back   So if by the time the bar closes And you feel like fallin' down I'll carry you home   Tonight We are young So let's set the world on fire We can burn brighter than the sun Tonight We are young So let's set the world on fire We can burn brighter than the sun  Now I know that I'm not all that you got I guess that I I just thought Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart But our friends are back so let's raise a toast 'Cause I found someone to carry me home   Tonight We are young So let's set the world on fire We can burn brighter than the sun Tonight We are young So let's set the world on fire We can burn brighter than the sun   Carry me home tonight  Just carry me home tonight  Carry me home tonight  Just carry me home tonight   The moon is on my side I have no reason to run  So will someone come and carry me home tonight  The angels never arrived but I can hear the choir  So will someone come and carry me home  Tonight We are young So let's set the world on fire We can burn brighter than the sun Tonight We are young So let's set the world on fire We can burn brighter than the sun   So if by the time the bar closes And you feel like fallin' down I'll carry you home tonight
