 I love you still And you know I always will Till the end of time I won't change my mind   I swear I'll always give my best no pretending Give you breakfast in bed every morning There ain't no answer to this complex question I just keep falling for you every day Won't ever take up too much time or attention Take a second just to make our connection I would do anything for your affection Kinda fun tryna go about it all the wrong ways   I'm just so into you I wanna let it all out You're so perfectly fine I could talk all day but let me spell it out A B C D E F G H   I love you still And you know I always will Till the end of time I won't change my mind Love you I'll be here I will never disappear Said forever I swear So I will be there  You said you didn't wanna be like everybody else Wanted something only you and I can have ourselves Picture perfect isn't something that I've ever felt Love when you smile right in front of me   I'm just so into you I wanna let it all out You're so perfectly fine I could talk all day but let me spell it out A B C D E F G H   I love you still And you know I always will Till the end of time I won't change my mind Love you I'll be here I will never disappear Said forever I swear So I will be there I love you still And you know I always will Till the end of time I won't change my mind Love you I'll be here I will never disappear Said forever I swear So I will be there
