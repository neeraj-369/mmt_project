 Never never never never I don't wanna hurt forever   You used to be my song love was the melody But now you overplayed it so much to make me hate it Her kisses in your phone I found it on our bed Hurts more than betrayal the fact that you never failed to   Trick my mind telling me the perfect lies Didn't want to see the signs Time after time time after time It's okay you belong to yesterday Never gonna make me stay This time I swear this time I say   N N N Never never never never I don't wanna hurt forever I will never never never never never never love Never never hurt forever I will never never never never never never love Never never never again  Nothing is set in stone that's what I heard you say Fighting a losing battle scores you can never settle I call you by your name my favorite mistake Hurts more than betrayal the fact that you never failed to   Trick my mind telling me the perfect lies Didn't want to see the signs Time after time time after time It's okay you belong to yesterday Never gonna make me stay This time I swear this time I say   N N N Never never never never I don't wanna hurt forever  Never never never again   N N N Never never never never I don't wanna hurt forever I will never never never never never never love Never never hurt forever I will never never never never never never love Never never never again
