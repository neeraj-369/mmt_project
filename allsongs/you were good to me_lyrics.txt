 Lyin' isn't better than silence Floatin' but I feel like I'm dyin'   Still no matter where I go At the end of every road You were good to me You were good to me yeah I know it's easier to run After everything I've done You were good to me You were good to me    You were good to me   You were good to me   Leavin' isn't better than tryin' Growin' but I'm just growin' tired   Now I'm worried for my soul And I'm still scared of growin' old You were good to me You were good to me yeah And I'm so used to lettin' go But I don't wanna be alone You were good to me You were good to me yeah oh  God only knows where our fears go Hearts I've broke now my tears flow You'll see that I'm sorry 'Cause you were good to me You were good to me   And now I'm closin' every door 'Cause I'm sick of wantin' more You were good to me You were good to me yeah Swear I'm different than before I won't hurt you anymore 'Cause you were good to me
