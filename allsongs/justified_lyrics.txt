 It was a fun strange summer I rolled on didn't think of you We lost touch with each other Fall came and I had to move   Movin' backwards hurt comes after Healin' doesn't happen in a straight line   If I cry just a little and then laugh in the middle If I hate you and I love you and then I change my mind If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact That you shoulda treated me right Then I'm more than just a little justified Mm mm I'm more than just a little justified   To touch somebody You know I tried to make that you And when you lied said you didn't want me Tell me what was I supposed to do   Movin' onwards feelin' strong but Healin' doesn't happen in a straight line  If I cry just a little and then laugh in the middle If I hate you and I love you and then I change my mind If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact That you shoulda treated me right Then I'm more than just a little justified Mm mm I'm more than just a little justified   If I die just a little inside just a little If I want you and I call you then I change my mind If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact That I shoulda treated you right I'm more than just a little   If I cry just a little and then laugh in the middle And I hate you and I love you and then I change my mind  If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact That you shoulda treated me right Then I'm more than just a little justified Mm mm I'm more than just a little justified
