 A voice calls a cry in the dark Telling me to crawl to the light But I won't the show has just begun I'm giving one last encore tonight   Five nights left to find you one last thing to tend to You'll fear what I can do but you'll never run Ghosts warn of my actions but I'm the main attraction You'll bring my satisfaction our little horror story's just begun      I believe after this final stand The end will come but not until you're gone I'm haunted a killer in a cage Using my undoing as my pawn   Five nights left to find you one last thing to tend to You'll fear what I can do but you'll never run Ghosts warn of my actions but I'm the main attraction You'll bring my satisfaction our little horror story's just begun  These metal gears and parts contain my purple heart They had their sweet revenge and brought me to an end Now I'm the monster here I'll make you disappear One last show to put on after tonight you're gone     Five nights left to find you one last thing to tend to You'll fear what I can do but you'll never run Ghosts warn of my actions but I'm the main attraction You'll bring my satisfaction our little horror story's just begun Five nights left to find you one last thing to tend to You'll fear what I can do but you'll never run Ghosts warn of my actions but I'm the main attraction You'll bring my satisfaction our little horror story's just begun
