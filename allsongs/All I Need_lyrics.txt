 I'm the next act waiting in the wings I'm an animal trapped in your hot car I am all the days that you choose to ignore   You are all I need You're all I need I'm in the middle of your picture Lying in the reeds   I am a moth who just wants to share your light I'm just an insect trying to get out of the night I only stick with you because there are no others   You are all I need You're all I need I'm in the middle of your picture Lying in the reeds   It's all wrong it's all wrong it's all wrong It's alright it's alright it's alright It's all wrong it's alright It's alright it's alright
