 Sometimes you get what you've always been wishing for And most times it's not on your deadline but that's alright I was worn out and jaded from trying on people to love But you fit so well   When they ask why I can never explain But a symphony played when you told me your name And I took that as a sign   Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be mine   Mmm mmm   Sometimes it's hard to see what the future holds And most times it feels like a steep climb and that's alright There's magic in details the tender small gestures of love And the way they all add up  When they ask why I can never explain But a symphony played when you told me your name And it sounded like a sign   Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be mine   Five years later and I'm still yours Ten years later and I'm still yours Fifty years later and I'm still your beginning and middle and end Five years later and I'm still yours Ten years later and I'm still yours Fifty years later and I'm still your beginning and middle and end Beginning and middle and end    Will you be my beginning my middle my end  Will you be my beginning my middle my end  Will you be my beginning my middle my end  Will you be mine
