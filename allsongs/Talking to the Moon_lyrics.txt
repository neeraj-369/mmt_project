 I know you're somewhere out there Somewhere far away I want you back I want you back My neighbors think I'm crazy But they don't understand You're all I had you're all I had   At night when the stars light up my room I sit by myself   Talking to the moon Tryna get to you In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon Oh   I'm feeling like I'm famous the talk of the town They say I've gone mad Yeah I've gone mad But they don't know what I know 'Cause when the sun goes down Someone's talkin' back Yeah they're talkin' back oh  At night when the stars light up my room I sit by myself   Talking to the moon Tryna get to you In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon   Oh oh oh oh oh oh Do you ever hear me calling Oh oh  oh oh  oh oh   'Cause every night I'm talking to the moon Still tryna get to you In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon Oh   I know you're somewhere out there Somewhere far away
