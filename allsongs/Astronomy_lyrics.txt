 We drive through the woods rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time young love don't last for life And now I know now I know It's time to go it's time to go   We've traveled the seas we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy we're two worlds apart    We're two worlds apart  We're two worlds apart   From far away I wish I'd stayed with you But here face to face a stranger that I once knew I thought if I wandered I'd fall back in love You said distance brings fondness but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run   We've traveled the seas we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy we're two worlds apart    We're two worlds apart   Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh we've died ooh   Oh we've traveled the seas we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy we're two worlds apart
