 I still remember third of December Me in your sweater you said it looked better On me than it did you only if you knew How much I liked you but I watch your eyes as she   Walks by What a sight for sore eyes Brighter than a blue sky She's got you mesmerized while I die   Why would you ever kiss me I'm not even half as pretty You gave her your sweater it's just polyester But you like her better wish I were Heather   Watch as she stands with her holding your hand Put your arm 'round her shoulder now I'm getting colder But how could I hate her She's such an angel But then again kinda wish she were dead as she   Walks by What a sight for sore eyes Brighter than a blue sky She's got you mesmerized while I die  Why would you ever kiss me I'm not even half as pretty You gave her your sweater it's just polyester But you like her better I wish I were Heather    Wish I were Heather  Wish I were Heather   Why would you ever kiss me I'm not even half as pretty You gave her your sweater it's just polyester But you like her better wish I were
