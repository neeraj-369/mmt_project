 You're an angel I'm a dog Or you're a dog and I'm your man You believe me like a god I destroy you like I am I'm sorry I'm the one you love No one will ever love me like you again So when you leave me I should die I deserve it don't I   I can feel it gettin' near Like flashlights comin' down the way One day you'll figure me out I'll meet judgment by the hounds People always gave me love Others were never to blame after all You believe me like a god I betray you like a man
