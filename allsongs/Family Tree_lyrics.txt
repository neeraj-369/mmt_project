 These crosses all over my body Remind me of who I used to be Give myself up to him in offering Let him make a woman out of me I'm just a child but I'm not above violence My mama raised me better than that When the preacher talks that man demands his silence And daddy said shoot first then run and don't look back   So take me down to the river and bathe me clean Put me on the back of your white horse to ride All the way to thе chapel let you wash all over mе   I've killed before and I'll kill again Take the noose off wrap it tight around my hand They say heaven hath no fury like a woman scorned And baby hell don't scare me I've been times before   So take me down to the river and bathe me clean Put me on the back of your white horse to ride All the way to the chapel let you wash all over me  These crosses all over my body Remind me of who I used to be Let Christ forgive these bones I've been hiding And the bones I'm about to leave   And take me down to the river and bathe me clean Put me on the back of your white horse to ride All the way to the chapel let you wash all over me
