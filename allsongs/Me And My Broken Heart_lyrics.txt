 All I need's a little love in my life All I need's a little love in the dark A little but I'm hoping it might kickstart Me and my broken heart I need a little loving tonight Hold me so I'm not falling apart A little but I'm hoping it might kickstart Me and my broken heart  Let's go   Shotgun aimed at my heart you got one Tear me apart and then some How do we call this love Drop  I try to run away but your eyes Tell me to stay oh why Why do we call this love    It seems like we've been losing control baby Somebody tell me I'm not alone When I say  All I need's a little love in my life All I need's a little love in the dark A little but I'm hoping it might kickstart Me and my broken heart I need a little loving tonight Hold me so I'm not falling apart A little but I'm hoping it might kickstart Me and my broken heart Aye   Maybe some part of you just hates me You pick me up and play me How do we call this love  One time tell me you need me tonight To make it easy You lie and say it's all for love    It seems like we've been losing control baby Somebody tell me I'm not alone When I say  All I need's a little love in my life All I need's a little love in the dark A little but I'm hoping it might kickstart Me and my broken heart I need a little loving tonight Hold me so I'm not falling apart A little but I'm hoping it might kickstart Me and my broken heart   Woah woah Me and my broken heart Woah woah Me and my broken Yeah yeah Me and my broken Yeah ooh  Ah ah ah ah   All I need's a little love in my life All I need's a little love in the dark A little but I'm hoping it might kickstart Me and my broken heart I need a little loving tonight Hold me so I'm not falling apart A little but I'm hoping it might kickstart Me and my broken heart Woo
