 Why  Who Me  Why    Feet don't fail me now take me to the finish line Oh my heart it breaks every step that I take But I'm hoping that the gates they'll tell me that you're mine Walking through the city streets is it by mistake or design I feel so alone on a Friday night Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine It's like I told you honey    Don't make me sad don't make me cry Sometimes love is not enough And the road gets tough I don't know why Keep makin' me laugh let's go get high The road is long we carry on Try to have fun in the meantime   Come and take a walk on the wild side Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain You like your girls insane  Choose your last words this is the last time 'Cause you and I we were born to die  Lost but now I am found I can see that once I was blind I was so confused as a little child Tried to take what I could get scared that I couldn't find All the answers honey    Don't make me sad don't make me cry Sometimes love is not enough And the road gets tough I don't know why Keep makin' me laugh let's go get high The road is long we carry on Try to have fun in the meantime   Come and take a walk on the wild side Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain You like your girls insane  Choose your last words this is the last time 'Cause you and I we were born to die    We were born to die  We were born to die Come and take a walk on the wild side Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain You like your girls insane  So don't make me sad don't make me cry Sometimes love is not enough And the road gets tough I don't know why Keep makin' me laugh let's go get high The road is long we carry on Try to have fun in the meantime   Come and take a walk on the wild side Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain You like your girls insane  Choose your last words this is the last time 'Cause you and I we were born to die     We were born to die
