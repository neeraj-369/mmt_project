 Ah ah Ah ah   You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you Be like Heaven to touch I wanna hold you so much Long last love has arrived I thank God that I'm alive You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you    Pardon the way that I stare There's nothing else to compare The thought of you leaves me weak There are no words left to speak But if you feel how I feel Please let me know that it's real You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you   I love you baby and if it's quite alright I need you baby to warm these lonely nights I love you baby trust in me when I say Oh pretty baby don't let me down I pray Oh pretty baby now that I have you stay And let me love you baby let me love you  You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you You'd be like Heaven to touch I wanna hold you so much Long last love has arrived I thank God that I'm alive You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you    Pardon the way that I stare There's nothing else to compare The thought of you leaves me weak There are no words left to speak But if you feel how I feel Please let me know that it's real You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you   I love you baby and if it's quite alright I need you baby to warm these lonely nights I love you baby trust in me when I say Oh pretty baby don't let me down I pray Oh pretty baby now that I have you stay And let me love you baby let me love you
