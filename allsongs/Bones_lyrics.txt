 Gimme gimme gimme some time to think I'm in the bathroom looking at me Face in the mirror is all I need  Wait until the reaper takes my life Never gonna get me out alive I will live a thousand million lives    My patience is waning is this entertaining Our patience is waning is this entertaining   I I I got this feeling yeah you know Where I'm losing all control 'Cause there's magic in my bones I I I got this feeling in my soul Go ahead and throw your stones 'Cause there's magic in my bones   Playin' with a stick of dynamitе There was nevеr gray in black and white There was never wrong 'til there was right  Feelin' like a boulder hurtlin' Seein' all the vultures circlin' Burnin' in the flames I'm workin' in Turnin' in a bed that's darkenin'  My patience is waning is this entertaining Our patience is waning is this entertaining   I I I got this feeling yeah you know Where I'm losing all control 'Cause there's magic in my bones  I I I got this feeling in my soul Go ahead and throw your stones 'Cause there's magic in my bones   'Cause there's magic in my bones   Look in the mirror of my mind Turnin' the pages of my life Walkin' the path so many paced a million times Drown out the voices in the air Leavin' the ones that never cared Pickin' the pieces up and buildin' to the sky   My patience is waning is this entertaining My patience is waning is this entertaining  I I I got this feeling yeah you know Where I'm losing all control 'Cause there's magic in my bones  I I I got this feeling in my soul  Go ahead and throw your stones 'Cause there's magic in my bones   There goes my mind  don't mind There goes my mind  There goes my mind  don't mind There goes my mind  'Cause there's magic in my bones
