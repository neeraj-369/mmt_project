   Do you recall not long ago We would walk on the sidewalk Innocent remember All we did was care for each other But the night was warm We were bold and young All around the wind blows We would only hold on to let go   Blow a kiss fire a gun We need someone to lean on Blow a kiss fire a gun All we need is somebody to lean on Blow a kiss fire a gun We need someone to lean on Blow a kiss fire a gun A A All we need is somebody to lean on      What will we do when we get old Will we walk down the same road Will you be there by my side Standin' strong as the waves roll over When the nights are long Longing for you to come home All around the wind blows We would only hold on to let go   Blow a kiss fire a gun We need someone to lean on Blow a kiss fire a gun All we need is somebody to lean on  Blow a kiss fire a gun We need someone to lean on Blow a kiss fire a gun A A All we need is somebody to lean on   All we need is somebody to lean on   A A All we need is somebody to lean on   Oh oh oh     Blow a kiss fire a gun  We need someone to lean on  Blow a kiss fire a gun  All we need is somebody to lean on  Blow a kiss fire a gun  We need someone to lean on  Blow a kiss fire a gun  A A All we need is somebody to lean on
