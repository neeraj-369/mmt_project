 I don't really understand it And you don't wanna talk about it So where do we go now What are we doin' I can't stand the silence So deafenin'   That look in your eye hits differently You've come to the point where you don't love me no more And I can't give you more Anymore anymore anymore   How do we make it better Should we admit that I'm not enough I thought we said Forever It's cold on the outside of love Can we rеignite the fire Or should wе admit we're givin' it up Right now I don't know why I'm cold on the outside of love   On the outside of love Outside of oh oh oh oh oh oh oh On the outside of love  I would rather you were happy Even if that means without me How long have you felt this  Have I been clueless I can't stand the silence So deafenin'   When I'm with you I just feel lonely There's thoughts in your head that you don't tell me no more  And I can't give you more Anymore anymore anymore   How do we make it better Should we admit that I'm not enough I thought we said Forever It's cold on the outside of love Can we reignite the fire Or should we admit that we're givin' it up Right now I don't know why I'm cold on the outside of love    On the outside of love  Oh on the outside of love  Outside of oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  Oh woah oh woah  Ooh ooh woah oh oh  Outside of oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  On the outside of love
