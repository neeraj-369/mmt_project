 Wanna ride with you 'til the wheels fall off 'Til we're running out of road Wanna dance with you 'til the music stops 'Til we got no place to go   Everybody needs a place to hide This don't have to be a bumpy ride I think we should be alone tonight 'Cause we don't have to be lonely Everybody needs some company Let's talk about it over one more drink I think you should be alone with me 'Cause we don't have to be lonely   Don't have to be lonely Lonely Don't have to be lonely lonely Don't have to be lonely Don't have to be lonely   Wanna ride with you 'til the world stands still Like there's no one else but us Wanna dance with you 'til we can't stand up 'Til we both give in to love  Everybody needs a place to hide This don't have to be a bumpy ride I think we should be alone tonight 'Cause we don't have to be lonely Everybody needs some company Let's talk about it over one more drink I think you should be alone with me 'Cause we don't have to be lonely   Don't have to be lonely Don't have to be lonely Don't have to be lonely Don't have to be Don't have to be lonely   Wanna ride with you 'til the wheels fall off 'Til we're running out of road
