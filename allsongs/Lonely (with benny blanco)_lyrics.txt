 Everybody knows my name now But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange Like lookin' in a mirror tryna steady yourself And seein' somebody else And everything is not the same now It feels like all our lives have changed Maybe when I'm older it'll all calm down But it's killin' me now   What if you had it all But nobody to call Maybe then you'd know me 'Cause I've had everything But no one's listening And that's just fuckin' lonely   I'm so lo o o onely Lo o o onely   Everybody knows my past now Like my house was always made of glass And maybe that's the price you pay For the money and fame at an early age And everybody saw me sick And it felt like no one gave a shit They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid  What if you had it all But nobody to call Maybe then you'd know me 'Cause I've had everything But no one's listening And that's just fuckin' lonely   I'm so lo o o onely Lo o o onely I'm so lo o o onely Lo o o onely
