 Let me feel you   It's been about a month and twenty days And we're going 'round and 'round playing silly games Now you're saying Slow it down not right now Then you wink at me and walk away   Let it be let it be let it be known Hold on don't go Touching and teasing me telling me no But this time I need to feel you   Ride it we're all alone Ride it just lose control Ride it ride it come touch my soul Ride it ride it let me feel you Ride it turn the lights down low Ride it from head to toe Ride it ride it touch my soul Ride it ride it let me feel you   Movida was the club on the Saturday You actin' like a diva sayin' you don't wanna pay It's gotta be ya feisty style raised eyebrow I love it when you look at me that way Now we're in you order a Mojito at the bar You re apply lippy 'cause it came off on the glass The DJ plays your favourite song Kanye's on Now ya beckoning for me to dance  Mmm pullin' me pullin' me pullin' me close Just close your eyes girl  Whispering tellin' me we gotta go Won't you take me home I wanna ride it   Ride it we're all alone Ride it just lose control Ride it ride it come touch my soul Ride it ride it let me feel you  Ride it turn the lights down low Ride it from head to toe Ride it ride it touch my soul Ride it ride it let me feel you   Everything was right until her phone began to ring She takes it to the corner that's when I start wondering I can hear her shouting banging fists against the door Yelling Yo it's over I can't take it anymore Then I walk away and act all nonchalant and chill I ain't tryna get all caught up in her mess for real But she came on out and backed me up against the wall She said I know you're hurt but I'll make you forget it all  Baby let me feel you Ride it we're all alone  Ride it just lose control  Ride it ride it come touch my soul  Ride it ride it let me feel you  Ride it turn the lights down low  Ride it from head to toe  Ride it ride it touch my soul Ride it ride it let me feel you
