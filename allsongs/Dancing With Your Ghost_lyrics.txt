 Yelling at the sky Screaming at the world Baby why'd you go away I’m still your girl Holding on too tight Head up in the clouds Heaven only knows where you are now   How do I love how do I love again How do I trust how do I trust again   I stay up all night tell myself I'm alright Baby you're just harder to see than most I put the record on wait ’til I hear our song Every night I'm dancing with your ghost Every night I'm dancing with your ghost   Never got the chance To say your last goodbye I gotta move on But it hurts to try  How do I love how do I love again How do I trust how do I trust again   I stay up all night tell myself I'm alright Baby you're just harder to see than most I put the record on wait 'til I hear our song Every night I'm dancing with your ghost Every night I'm dancing with your ghost   How do I love how do I love again How do I trust how do I trust again   I stay up all night tell myself I’m alright Baby you’re just harder to see than most I put the record on wait 'til I hear our song Every night I’m dancing with your ghost Every night I'm dancing with your ghost Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
