 I didn't think I was a bad guy I knew that you were good You were golden on the inside And you loved me the best you could I'm the one who dropped the ball Got you high and let you fall Let the best thing I ever had slip away   What does that say about me I could do you like I did That I could break an angel's wings What does that say about me That I stood there like a fencepost As you drove off in your car What does that say about me Now that I've broke your pretty heart Your pretty heart   I've been drinkin' like a drunkard In these Austin neon lights Burning smokes and wondering If there's anything I've done right Well I wish that I could go back Hang on to what I had Guess that's all babe Nothin' but a dream  What does that say about me I could do you like I did That I could break an angel's wings What does that say about me That I stood there like a fencepost As you drove off in your car What does that say about me Now that I've broke your pretty heart Your pretty heart     What does that say about me I could do you like I did That I could break an angel's wings What does that say about me That I stood there like a fencepost As you drove off in your car What does that say about me Now that I've broke your pretty heart Your pretty heart Your pretty heart Your pretty heart
