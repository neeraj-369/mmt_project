 I'll sing it one last time for you Then we really have to go You've been the only thing that's right In all I've done   And I can barely look at you But every single time I do I know we'll make it anywhere Away from here   Light up light up As if you have a choice Even if you cannot hear my voice I'll be right beside you dear Louder louder And we'll run for our lives I can hardly speak I understand Why you can't raise your voice to say   To think I might not see those eyes Makes it so hard not to cry And as we say our long goodbye I nearly do  Light up light up As if you have a choice Even if you cannot hear my voice I'll be right beside you dear Louder louder And we'll run for our lives I can hardly speak I understand Why you can't raise your voice to say   Slower slower We don't have time for that All I want's to find an easy way To get out of our little heads Have heart my dear We're bound to be afraid Even if it's just for a few days Making up for all this mess     Light up light up As if you have a choice Even if you cannot hear my voice I'll be right beside you dear
