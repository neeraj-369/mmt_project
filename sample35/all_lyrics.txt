 How long have you been smiling It seems like it's been too long Some days I don't feel like trying So what the fuck are you on Oh woah oh oh   I think too much we drink too much Falling in love like it's just nothing I want to know where do we go When nothing's wrong   'Cause all the kids are depressed Nothing ever makes sense I'm not feeling alright Staying up 'til sunrise And hoping shit is okay Pretending we know things I don't know what happened My natural reaction is that we're scared So I guess we're scared   No I can't really keep lying 'Cause I've been scared all along I'm getting sick of sleeping in While all my friends are popping pills And I don't think that they're wrong Oh woah oh oh  I think too much we drink too much Falling apart like it's just nothing I want to know where do we go When nothing's wrong   'Cause all the kids are depressed Nothing ever makes sense I'm not feeling alright Staying up 'til sunrise And hoping shit is okay Pretending we know things I don't know what happened My natural reaction is that we're scared So I guess we're scared   I won't deny it 'cause you saw what it was I can't deny it if you won't give a fuck So I'll sew it up You know I am so in love
 There's no reason there's no rhyme I found myself blindsided by A feeling that I've never known I'm dealing with it on my own Phone is quiet walls are bare I drink myself to sleep who cares No one even has to know I'm dealing with it on my own   I've got way too much time to be this hurt Somebody help it's getting worse What do you do with a broken heart Once the light fades everything is dark Way too much whiskey in my blood I feel my body giving up Can I hold on for another night What do I do with all this time   Heavy thoughts when it gets late Put me in a fragile state I wish I wasn't going home Dealing with it on my own I'm praying but it's not enough I'm done I don't believe in love Learning how to let it go Dealing with it on my own  I've got way too much time to be this hurt Somebody help it's getting worse What do you do with a broken heart Once the light fades everything is dark Way too much whiskey in my blood I feel my body giving up Can I hold on for another night What do I do with all this time Yeah   I drive circles under street lights Nothing seems to clear my mind I can't forget Get this out my head so I drive chasing Malibu nights Nothing seems to heal my mind I can't forget   I've got way too much time to be this hurt Somebody help it's getting worse What do you do with a broken heart Once the light fades everything is dark Way too much whiskey in my blood I feel my body giving up Can I hold on for another night What do I do with all this time Yeah  I drive circles under street lights Nothing seems to clear my mind I can't forget Get this out my head so I drive chasing Malibu nights Nothing seems to heal my mind I can't forget  I drive chasing Malibu nights Hey yeah na na ah yeah

 The snow glows white on the mountain tonight Not a footprint to be seen A kingdom of isolation And it looks like I'm the queen The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside Couldn't keep it in Heaven knows I tried   Don't let them in don't let them see Be the good girl you always have to be Conceal don't feel don't let them know Well now they know   Let it go let it go Can't hold it back anymore Let it go let it go Turn away and slam the door I don't care what they're going to say Let the storm rage on The cold never bothered me anyway   It's funny how some distance Makes everything seem small And the fears that once controlled me Can't get to me at all  It's time to see what I can do To test the limits and break through No right no wrong no rules for me I'm free   Let it go let it go I'm one with the wind and sky Let it go let it go You'll never see me cry Here I stand and here I'll stay Let the storm rage on   My power flurries through the air into the ground My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast I'm never going back the past is in the past   Let it go let it go And I'll rise like the break of dawn Let it go let it go That perfect girl is gone Here I stand in the light of day Let the storm rage on The cold never bothered me anyway

 My heart's a stereo It beats for you so listen close Hear my thoughts in every no— Oh—ote Make me your radio  And turn me up when you feel low  This melody was meant for you  To sing along to my stereo    If I was just another dusty record on the shelf Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else If I asked you to scratch my back could you manage that Like yikky yeah check it Travie I can handle that Furthermore I apologize for any skipping tracks It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks I used to used to used to used to now I'm over that 'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts   If I could only find a note to make you understand I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand Just keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you   My heart's a stereo It beats for you so listen close Hear my thoughts in every no—  Oh—ote  Make me your radio  And turn me up when you feel low  This melody was meant for you To sing along to my stereo   Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh  Oh oh oh oh To sing along to my stereo Let's go   If I was an old school fifty pound boombox  Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops  And crank it higher every time they told you to stop  And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me When you have to purchase mad D batteries Appreciate every mixtape your friends make You never know we come and go like on the interstate   I think I finally found a note to make you understand If you could hit it sing along and take me by the hand Just keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you    My heart's a stereo  It beats for you so listen close  Hear my thoughts in every no— Oh—ote  Make me your radio  And turn me up when you feel low  This melody was meant for you To sing along to my stereo    Oh oh oh oh oh  Oh oh oh  Oh oh oh oh To sing along to my stereo    I only pray you never leave me behind  Because good music can be so hard to find  I'll take your hand and hold it closer to mine  Thought love was dead but now you're changing my mind   My heart's a stereo  It beats for you so listen close Hear my thoughts in every no— Oh—ote  Make me your radio  And turn me up when you feel low  This melody was meant for you To sing along to my stereo   Oh oh oh oh oh  Yeah yeah ye—eh—eh Oh oh oh oh  Yeah yeah ye—eh—eh Oh oh oh  Yeah yeah ye—eh—eh  To sing along to my stereo Yeah yeah yeah Yeah
