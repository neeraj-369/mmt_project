 I still remember third of December Me in your sweater you said it looked better On me than it did you only if you knew How much I liked you but I watch your eyes as she   Walks by What a sight for sore eyes Brighter than a blue sky She's got you mesmerized while I die   Why would you ever kiss me I'm not even half as pretty You gave her your sweater it's just polyester But you like her better wish I were Heather   Watch as she stands with her holding your hand Put your arm 'round her shoulder now I'm getting colder But how could I hate her She's such an angel But then again kinda wish she were dead as she   Walks by What a sight for sore eyes Brighter than a blue sky She's got you mesmerized while I die  Why would you ever kiss me I'm not even half as pretty You gave her your sweater it's just polyester But you like her better I wish I were Heather    Wish I were Heather  Wish I were Heather   Why would you ever kiss me I'm not even half as pretty You gave her your sweater it's just polyester But you like her better wish I were
 Can you remember remember my name As I flow through your life A thousand oceans I have flown Oh oh oh And cold cold spirits of ice ah ah All my life I am the echo of your past   I am returning the echo of a point in time And distant faces shine A thousand warriors I have known Oh oh oh oh And laughing as the spirits appear All your life Shadows of another day   And if you hear me talking on the wind You've got to understand We must remain perfect strangers   Ah ah ah no I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow   A strand of silver hanging through the sky Touching more than you see The voice of ages in your mind oh oh oh Is aching with the dead of the night Oh uh oh precious life Your tears are lost in falling rain   And if you hear me talking on the wind You've got to understand We must remain perfect strangers   Oh oh oh Oh yeah
 Sometimes you get what you've always been wishing for And most times it's not on your deadline but that's alright I was worn out and jaded from trying on people to love But you fit so well   When they ask why I can never explain But a symphony played when you told me your name And I took that as a sign   Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be mine   Mmm mmm   Sometimes it's hard to see what the future holds And most times it feels like a steep climb and that's alright There's magic in details the tender small gestures of love And the way they all add up  When they ask why I can never explain But a symphony played when you told me your name And it sounded like a sign   Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be mine   Five years later and I'm still yours Ten years later and I'm still yours Fifty years later and I'm still your beginning and middle and end Five years later and I'm still yours Ten years later and I'm still yours Fifty years later and I'm still your beginning and middle and end Beginning and middle and end    Will you be my beginning my middle my end  Will you be my beginning my middle my end  Will you be my beginning my middle my end  Will you be mine
