 Go for it One two   Baby really hurt me crying in the taxi He don't wanna know me Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm Says it was poison So I guess I'll go home Into the arms of the girl that I love The only love I haven't screwed up She's so hard to please but she's a forest fire I do my best to meet her demands play at romance We slow dance in the living room But all that a stranger would see Is one girl swaying alone stroking a cheek   They say You're a little much for me You're a liability You're a little much for me So they pull back make other plans I understand I'm a liability Get you wild make you leave I'm a little much for e a na na na everyone  The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy Till all of the tricks don't work anymore And then they are bored of me I know that it's exciting running through the night But every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone Better on my own   They say You're a little much for me You're a liability You're a little much for me So they pull back make other plans I understand I'm a liability Get you wild make you leave I'm a little much for e a na na na everyone   They're gonna watch me disappear into the sun You're all gonna watch me disappear into the sun
 When you love someone you'll do anything You'll do all the crazy things that you can't explain You'll shoot the moon put out the sun When you love someone   You'll deny the truth believe a lie There'll be times that you'll believe you could really fly But your lonely nights have just begun When you love someone   When you love someone you'll feel it deep inside And nothing else could ever change your mind When you want someone when you need someone When you love someone     When you love someone you'll sacrifice You'd give it everything you got and you won't think twice You'd risk it all no matter what may come When you love someone  You'll shoot the moon put out the sun When you love someone

 You're an angel I'm a dog Or you're a dog and I'm your man You believe me like a god I destroy you like I am I'm sorry I'm the one you love No one will ever love me like you again So when you leave me I should die I deserve it don't I   I can feel it gettin' near Like flashlights comin' down the way One day you'll figure me out I'll meet judgment by the hounds People always gave me love Others were never to blame after all You believe me like a god I betray you like a man
 I'll sing it one last time for you Then we really have to go You've been the only thing that's right In all I've done   And I can barely look at you But every single time I do I know we'll make it anywhere Away from here   Light up light up As if you have a choice Even if you cannot hear my voice I'll be right beside you dear Louder louder And we'll run for our lives I can hardly speak I understand Why you can't raise your voice to say   To think I might not see those eyes Makes it so hard not to cry And as we say our long goodbye I nearly do  Light up light up As if you have a choice Even if you cannot hear my voice I'll be right beside you dear Louder louder And we'll run for our lives I can hardly speak I understand Why you can't raise your voice to say   Slower slower We don't have time for that All I want's to find an easy way To get out of our little heads Have heart my dear We're bound to be afraid Even if it's just for a few days Making up for all this mess     Light up light up As if you have a choice Even if you cannot hear my voice I'll be right beside you dear
