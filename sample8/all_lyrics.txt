   For all the times that you rained on my parade And all the clubs you get in using my name You think you broke my heart oh girl for goodness' sake You think I'm cryin' on my own well I ain't   And I didn't wanna write a song 'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care I don't but you still hit my phone up And baby I'll be movin' on And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back Maybe you should know that   My mama don't like you and she likes everyone And I never like to admit that I was wrong And I've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going on But now I know I'm better sleeping on my own   'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself  But when you told me that you hated my friends The only problem was with you and not them And every time you told me my opinion was wrong And tried to make me forget where I came from   And I didn't wanna write a song 'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care I don't but you still hit my phone up And baby I'll be movin' on And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back Maybe you should know that   My mama don't like you and she likes everyone And I never like to admit that I was wrong And I've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going on But now I know I'm better sleeping on my own   'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself  For all the times that you made me feel small I fell in love now I feel nothin' at all I never felt so low and I was vulnerable Was I a fool to let you break down my walls   'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself 'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself

 Mama we all go to Hell Mama we all go to Hell I'm writing this letter and wishing you well Mama we all go to Hell Oh well now Mama we're all gonna die Mama we're all gonna die Stop asking me questions I'd hate to see you cry Mama we're all gonna die   And when we go don't blame us yeah We'll let the fires just bathe us yeah You made us oh so famous We'll never let you go And when you go don't return to me my love   Mama we're all full of lies Mama we're meant for the flies And right now they're building a coffin your size Mama we're all full of lies   Well mother what the war did to my legs and to my tongue You should've raised a baby girl I should've been a better son If you could coddle the infection they can amputate at once You should've been I could have been a better son  And when we go don't blame us yeah We'll let the fires just bathe us yeah You made us oh so famous We'll never let you go   She said You ain't no son of mine For what you've done they're gonna find A place for you and just you mind your manners when you go And when you go don't return to me my love that's right   Mama we all go to Hell Mama we all go to Hell It's really quite pleasant except for the smell Mama we all go to Hell    Mama Mama Mama Mama Mama Mama Ma   And if you would call me a sweetheart I'd maybe then sing you a song But there's shit that I've done with this fuck of a gun You would cry out your eyes all along  We're damned after all Through fortune and flame we fall And if you can stay then I'll show you the way To return from the ashes you call We all carry on  When our brothers in arms are gone  So raise your glass high for tomorrow we die And return from the ashes you call
 We don't talk anymore we don't talk anymore We don't talk anymore like we used to do We don't love anymore What was all of it for Oh we don't talk anymore Like we used to do   I just heard you found the one you've been looking You've been looking for I wish I would have known that wasn't me 'Cause even after all this time I still wonder Why I can't move on Just the way you did so easily   Don't wanna know What kind of dress you're wearing tonight If he's holding onto you so tight The way I did before I overdosed Should've known your love was a game Now I can't get you out of my brain Oh it's such a shame  That we don't talk anymore we don't talk anymore We don't talk anymore like we used to do We don't love anymore What was all of it for Oh we don't talk anymore Like we used to do   I just hope you're lying next to somebody Who knows how to love you like me There must be a good reason that you're gone Every now and then I think you Might want me to come show up at your door But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong   Don't wanna know If you're looking into her eyes If she's holding onto you so tight The way I did before I overdosed Should've known your love was a game Now I can't get you out of my brain Oh it's such a shame  That we don't talk anymore we don't talk anymore We don't talk anymore like we used to do We don't love anymore What was all of it for Oh we don't talk anymore Like we used to do Like we used to do   Don't wanna know What kind of dress you're wearing tonight If he's giving it to you just right The way I did before I overdosed Should've known your love was a game Now I can't get you out of my brain Oh it's such a shame   That we don't talk anymore We don't laugh anymore What was all of it for Oh we don't talk anymore Like we used to do  We don't talk anymore oh oh We don't talk anymore oh whoa We don't talk anymore
 Sometimes you get what you've always been wishing for And most times it's not on your deadline but that's alright I was worn out and jaded from trying on people to love But you fit so well   When they ask why I can never explain But a symphony played when you told me your name And I took that as a sign   Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be mine   Mmm mmm   Sometimes it's hard to see what the future holds And most times it feels like a steep climb and that's alright There's magic in details the tender small gestures of love And the way they all add up  When they ask why I can never explain But a symphony played when you told me your name And it sounded like a sign   Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be my beginning my middle my end Will you be mine   Five years later and I'm still yours Ten years later and I'm still yours Fifty years later and I'm still your beginning and middle and end Five years later and I'm still yours Ten years later and I'm still yours Fifty years later and I'm still your beginning and middle and end Beginning and middle and end    Will you be my beginning my middle my end  Will you be my beginning my middle my end  Will you be my beginning my middle my end  Will you be mine
