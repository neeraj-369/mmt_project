 Go for it One two   Baby really hurt me crying in the taxi He don't wanna know me Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm Says it was poison So I guess I'll go home Into the arms of the girl that I love The only love I haven't screwed up She's so hard to please but she's a forest fire I do my best to meet her demands play at romance We slow dance in the living room But all that a stranger would see Is one girl swaying alone stroking a cheek   They say You're a little much for me You're a liability You're a little much for me So they pull back make other plans I understand I'm a liability Get you wild make you leave I'm a little much for e a na na na everyone  The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy Till all of the tricks don't work anymore And then they are bored of me I know that it's exciting running through the night But every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone Better on my own   They say You're a little much for me You're a liability You're a little much for me So they pull back make other plans I understand I'm a liability Get you wild make you leave I'm a little much for e a na na na everyone   They're gonna watch me disappear into the sun You're all gonna watch me disappear into the sun
 Never never never never I don't wanna hurt forever   You used to be my song love was the melody But now you overplayed it so much to make me hate it Her kisses in your phone I found it on our bed Hurts more than betrayal the fact that you never failed to   Trick my mind telling me the perfect lies Didn't want to see the signs Time after time time after time It's okay you belong to yesterday Never gonna make me stay This time I swear this time I say   N N N Never never never never I don't wanna hurt forever I will never never never never never never love Never never hurt forever I will never never never never never never love Never never never again  Nothing is set in stone that's what I heard you say Fighting a losing battle scores you can never settle I call you by your name my favorite mistake Hurts more than betrayal the fact that you never failed to   Trick my mind telling me the perfect lies Didn't want to see the signs Time after time time after time It's okay you belong to yesterday Never gonna make me stay This time I swear this time I say   N N N Never never never never I don't wanna hurt forever  Never never never again   N N N Never never never never I don't wanna hurt forever I will never never never never never never love Never never hurt forever I will never never never never never never love Never never never again
